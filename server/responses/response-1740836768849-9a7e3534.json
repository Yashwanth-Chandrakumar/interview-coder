Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to implement a function that checks if a given string s matches a pattern p. The pattern can contain '*' and '?'. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the pattern supports '*' and '+'? Wait, no, the user wrote: 'given an input string s and a pattern p, implement wildcard pattern matching with support for 2+ and 'x' where... Hmm, wait, maybe that's a typo. Looking back, the problem says the pattern has '*' and '?', but in the initial problem statement, the user wrote 'x' and '+', but perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, looking at the examples, for example, in example 2, the pattern is \"x\", and s is \"aa\". So maybe in this problem, the wildcards are '*' and '+', but that's a bit unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to the standard wildcard problem where '*' matches any sequence of characters, and '?' matches any single character.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. The user wrote: 'support for 2+ and 'x''. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Looking at the example 2, the pattern is \"x\", which matches \"aa\" and returns true. So in that case, perhaps 'x' is a wildcard that can match any number of characters. Wait, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses '*' and '+' as wildcards. Or perhaps the user made a mistake and it's actually '*' and '?', which is the standard LeetCode problem.\n\nWait, the problem link is to LeetCode's wildcard matching problem, which is problem 44. So I should check what that problem says.\n\nLooking it up, LeetCode problem 44 is Wildcard Matching, where the pattern can contain '*' and '?', where '*' matches any sequence of characters (including empty), and '?' matches any single character.\n\nSo, the problem is to determine if the string s matches the pattern p, with '*' and '?'.\n\nSo the function isMatch(s, p) returns true if s matches p.\n\nNow, how to approach this problem.\n\nI remember that this is a classic dynamic programming problem. The approach is to use a DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether the first i characters of s match the first j characters of p.\n\nThe base cases are:\n- dp[0][0] = True (empty string matches empty pattern)\n- dp[i][0] = False for i > 0 (non-empty string can't match empty pattern)\n- dp[0][j] = True only if all characters in p up to j are '*' because '*' can match zero or more characters.\n\nFor the transitions:\n- If p[j-1] is '?', then it can match any single character, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].\n- If p[j-1] is '*', then it can match zero or more characters. So, we have a few possibilities:\n   a. '*' matches zero characters: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]\n   b. '*' matches one or more characters: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n   So, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]\n- If p[j-1] is a regular character, then s[i-1] must equal p[j-1], and dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n\nBut wait, that's the standard approach, but implementing it directly may lead to high time and space complexity. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nThe constraints for LeetCode problem 44 are that s and p can be up to 2000 characters long. So a DP approach with O(n*m) time and space should be acceptable, as 2000*2000 is 4 million, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize space by using a 1D array instead of a 2D array.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a DP table with (len(s)+1) rows and (len(p)+1) columns.\n\n2. Set dp[0][0] = True.\n\n3. Fill the first row (i=0, j from 1 to len(p)):\n   dp[0][j] is True if p[j-1] is '*' and dp[0][j-1] is True. Because '*' can match zero or more, but in this case, it's matching zero, so each '*' in the pattern can allow the dp[0][j] to be True.\n\n4. Fill the first column (i from 1 to len(s), j=0):\n   dp[i][0] is False because an empty pattern can't match any non-empty string.\n\n5. For each i from 1 to len(s), and j from 1 to len(p):\n   a. If p[j-1] is '?', then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n   b. If p[j-1] is '*', then dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (match zero) or dp[i-1][j] (match one or more)\n   c. Else, if s[i-1] == p[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n   d. Else, dp[i][j] = False\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', it's possible that the '*' can match multiple characters, so we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, but in the DP approach, the order of checking is important. For example, when p[j-1] is '*', we can set dp[i][j] to be true if either dp[i][j-1] is true (meaning the '*' is used to match zero characters) or dp[i-1][j] is true (meaning the '*' is used to match one or more, so we move back in s but not in p).\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', it's possible that the '*' can match any number of characters, including zero. So for dp[i][j], it's true if either:\n- the current character in p is '*' and either:\n   - the previous state in p (j-1) is true (meaning '*' matches zero characters)\n   - or the previous state in s (i-1) is true (meaning '*' matches one or more characters)\n- or, if p[j-1] is '?' and s[i-1] matches it, so dp[i-1][j-1] is true\n- or, if p[j-1] is a regular character, and s[i-1] equals p[j-1], and dp[i-1][j-1] is true.\n\nSo, implementing this logic in a DP table.\n\nBut considering that the DP approach uses O(n*m) space, which is acceptable for n and m up to 2000, but perhaps we can optimize the space by using a 1D array and updating it in place.\n\nLet's think about the 1D approach.\n\nWe can represent the DP state with a 1D array of size len(p)+1, where dp[j] represents whether the first j characters of p match some prefix of s.\n\nWe can initialize dp[0] = True.\n\nThen, for each character in s, we iterate through the pattern and update the dp array.\n\nWait, but the order in which we process the characters matters. For the '*' case, when processing from left to right, we need to make sure that we don't overwrite the dp[j] values that we might need for the current iteration.\n\nWait, perhaps for the 1D approach, when handling '*', we need to process the pattern from right to left to prevent overwriting the dp[j-1] values that are needed for the current step.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's consider the 1D approach.\n\nInitialize dp as a 1D array of size len(p)+1, with dp[0] = True.\n\nFor each character in s:\n   create a temporary array new_dp as a copy of dp.\n   for each j from 1 to len(p):\n      if p[j-1] is '?':\n          new_dp[j] = dp[j-1]\n      elif p[j-1] is '*':\n          new_dp[j] = new_dp[j-1] or dp[j]\n          // Wait, no, because '*' can match zero or more, so if p[j-1] is '*', then new_dp[j] = new_dp[j-1] (matching zero) or dp[j] (matching one or more)\n          // But wait, in the 1D approach, the new_dp is being built, so perhaps we need to check if the previous positions allow for this.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to process the pattern in reverse when handling the '*' to prevent overwriting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2D approach is easier to implement, but uses more memory. Since the constraints are len(s) and len(p) up to 2000, a 2D array of 2001 x 2001 is manageable (about 4 million entries), which is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the 2D approach is easier to implement correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the 2D DP.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of (len(s)+1) x (len(p)+1), all set to False.\n\nSet dp[0][0] = True.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len(s):\n   for each j from 1 to len(p):\n      if p[j-1] == '*':\n          // can match zero or more\n          dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or (i>0 and dp[i-1][j])\n      elif p[j-1] == '?':\n          if i > 0:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n      else:\n          if i > 0 and s[i-1] == p[j-1]:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n\nWait, but in the case where p[j-1] is '*', we have to consider whether the current '*' can match zero or more characters. So, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (zero matches) OR dp[i-1][j] (one or more matches). But wait, in the 2D approach, when processing i and j, dp[i][j] depends on dp[i][j-1] (same i, previous j) and dp[i-1][j] (previous i, same j). So, the order of processing is important.\n\nWait, let me think about how to fill the DP table.\n\nWe can process each i from 0 to len(s), and for each i, process each j from 0 to len(p).\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', the current state depends on the previous j (same i, j-1) and the previous i (i-1, j). So, for each j, when p[j-1] is '*', we can set dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j], provided that i>0.\n\nWait, but in code, how to handle that.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D list of (len(s)+1) rows and (len(p)+1) columns, all False.\n\ndp[0][0] = True.\n\nThen, for j from 1 to len(p):\n   if p[j-1] == '*':\n      dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]  // because '*' can match zero, so if the previous state was True, this is also True.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to len(s):\n   for j from 1 to len(p):\n      if p[j-1] == '*':\n          dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]\n      elif p[j-1] == '?':\n          if i > 0:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n      else:\n          if i >0 and s[i-1] == p[j-1]:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', the dp[i][j] can be True if either the previous j-1 is True (meaning the '*' matches zero characters, so we take the same i, j-1) or if the previous i-1, j is True (meaning the '*' matches one or more, so we take i-1, j).\n\nSo, in code, for each i and j, we process the p[j-1] character.\n\nWait, but in the 2D approach, the order of processing i and j is important. Because for each i, j, we need to have already computed dp[i][j-1] and dp[i-1][j].\n\nYes, because for each i, j, when j increases, j-1 has already been processed for the same i.\n\nSimilarly, for i, when processing j, the i-1 has been processed for all j up to current j.\n\nSo, the 2D approach can be implemented as follows.\n\nBut wait, another thing to consider: when p[j-1] is '*', and we're at i=0, j>0. Because when i=0, s is empty, so p[j] must consist of all '*' to be True.\n\nWait, in the initial step, for i=0, we have to set dp[0][j] to True if p[0..j-1] is all '*'s.\n\nSo, the initial step is:\n\nfor j from 1 to len(p):\n   if p[j-1] == '*' and dp[0][j-1] is True:\n       dp[0][j] = True\n   else:\n       dp[0][j] = False\n\nSo, for j=1, if p[0] is '*', then dp[0][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\nFor j=2, if p[1] is '*', then dp[0][2] = dp[0][1] (which is True), so dp[0][2] = True.\n\nSo, the initial step for i=0 is handled.\n\nNow, let's think about the test cases.\n\nExample 1:\ns = \"aa\", p = \"a\" → output is False.\n\nBecause \"a\" can't match \"aa\".\n\nIn the DP table:\ndp[0][0] = True\ndp[0][1] = False (since p[0] is 'a' which doesn't match empty string)\nSo, for i=1 (s[0] is 'a'), j=1:\np[0] is 'a', s[0] is 'a', so dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\nFor j=1, i=2:\np[0] is 'a' which doesn't match s[1], so dp[2][1] is False.\n\nThus, dp[2][1] is False, which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: s = \"aa\", p = \"a*\"\n\nSo, p is \"a*\".\n\nSo, for j=2 (p[1] is '*'), dp[2][2] should be True.\n\nIn the DP table:\n\ndp[0][0] = True.\n\nj=1 (p[0] is 'a'):\n\ndp[0][1] is False, because 'a' can't match empty string.\n\ni=1, j=1: s[0] is 'a', p[0] is 'a' → dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\ni=2, j=1: p[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'a' → dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] which is False, because dp[i-1][j-1] is dp[1][0], which is False. Wait, no, wait, for j=1, p[0] is 'a', and s[i-1] is 'a' for i=2. So, since p[j-1] is 'a' and s[i-1] is 'a', then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. So for i=2, j=1: dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] which is False, because dp[1][0] is False.\n\nBut in the case where p[j-1] is '*', for j=2, i=2:\n\ndp[2][2] = dp[2][1] or dp[1][2]\n\nBut for j=2, p[1] is '*'.\n\nSo, for i=2, j=2:\n\ndp[2][2] = dp[2][1] (if '*' matches zero) OR dp[1][2] (if '*' matches one or more).\n\nBut what is dp[2][1]?\n\nIn this case, p[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'a', but dp[2][1] is dp[1][0] which is False. So, dp[2][1] is False.\n\nBut dp[1][2] would be dp[1][1] OR dp[0][2] (if j-1 is 1, p[1] is '*').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to code the 2D approach and test it against some test cases.\n\nAnother test case: s = \"ab\", p = \"*\".\n\nThen, the pattern is \"*\", which can match any string, including \"ab\".\n\nSo, dp[0][1] is True.\n\nFor i=1, j=1: p[j-1] is '*', so dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] or dp[0][1]. dp[1][0] is False (since j=0 is only True at i=0). dp[0][1] is True. So, dp[1][1] = True.\n\nSimilarly, for i=2, j=1: dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] (False) OR dp[1][1] (True). So, dp[2][1] is True.\n\nSo, the final dp[len(s)][len(p)] is True.\n\nAnother test case: s = \"ab\", p = \"?*\"\n\np is \"?*\". Let's see:\n\nAt j=1, p[0] is '?', which matches any single character. So for i=1, j=1: dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\nAt j=2, p[1",

Initialize a DP table with (len(s)+1) rows and (len(p)+1) columns.\n\n2. Set dp[0][0] = True.\n\n3. Fill the first row (i=0, j from 1 to len(p)):\n   dp[0][j] is True if p[j-1] is '*' and dp[0][j-1] is True.

Fill the first column (i from 1 to len(s), j=0):\n   dp[i][0] is False because an empty pattern can't match any non-empty string.\n\n5. For each i from 1 to len(s), and j from 1 to len(p):\n   a.

Else, if s[i-1] == p[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n   d. Else, dp[i][j] = False\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', it's possible that the '*' can match multiple characters, so we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, but in the DP approach, the order of checking is important. For example, when p[j-1] is '*', we can set dp[i][j] to be true if either dp[i][j-1] is true (meaning the '*' is used to match zero characters) or dp[i-1][j] is true (meaning the '*' is used to match one or more, so we move back in s but not in p).\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', it's possible that the '*' can match any number of characters, including zero.

So, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] (zero matches) OR dp[i-1][j] (one or more matches). But wait, in the 2D approach, when processing i and j, dp[i][j] depends on dp[i][j-1] (same i, previous j) and dp[i-1][j] (previous i, same j). So, the order of processing is important.\n\nWait, let me think about how to fill the DP table.\n\nWe can process each i from 0 to len(s), and for each i, process each j from 0 to len(p).\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', the current state depends on the previous j (same i, j-1) and the previous i (i-1, j). So, for each j, when p[j-1] is '*', we can set dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j], provided that i>0.\n\nWait, but in code, how to handle that.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D list of (len(s)+1) rows and (len(p)+1) columns, all False.\n\ndp[0][0] = True.\n\nThen, for j from 1 to len(p):\n   if p[j-1] == '*':\n      dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]  // because '*' can match zero, so if the previous state was True, this is also True.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to len(s):\n   for j from 1 to len(p):\n      if p[j-1] == '*':\n          dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] or dp[i-1][j]\n      elif p[j-1] == '?':\n          if i > 0:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n      else:\n          if i >0 and s[i-1] == p[j-1]:\n              dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]\n          else:\n              dp[i][j] = False\n\nWait, but in the case of '*', the dp[i][j] can be True if either the previous j-1 is True (meaning the '*' matches zero characters, so we take the same i, j-1) or if the previous i-1, j is True (meaning the '*' matches one or more, so we take i-1, j).\n\nSo, in code, for each i and j, we process the p[j-1] character.\n\nWait, but in the 2D approach, the order of processing i and j is important. Because for each i, j, we need to have already computed dp[i][j-1] and dp[i-1][j].\n\nYes, because for each i, j, when j increases, j-1 has already been processed for the same i.\n\nSimilarly, for i, when processing j, the i-1 has been processed for all j up to current j.\n\nSo, the 2D approach can be implemented as follows.\n\nBut wait, another thing to consider: when p[j-1] is '*', and we're at i=0, j>0. Because when i=0, s is empty, so p[j] must consist of all '*' to be True.\n\nWait, in the initial step, for i=0, we have to set dp[0][j] to True if p[0..j-1] is all '*'s.\n\nSo, the initial step is:\n\nfor j from 1 to len(p):\n   if p[j-1] == '*' and dp[0][j-1] is True:\n       dp[0][j] = True\n   else:\n       dp[0][j] = False\n\nSo, for j=1, if p[0] is '*', then dp[0][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\nFor j=2, if p[1] is '*', then dp[0][2] = dp[0][1] (which is True), so dp[0][2] = True.\n\nSo, the initial step for i=0 is handled.\n\nNow, let's think about the test cases.\n\nExample 1:\ns = \"aa\", p = \"a\" → output is False.\n\nBecause \"a\" can't match \"aa\".\n\nIn the DP table:\ndp[0][0] = True\ndp[0][1] = False (since p[0] is 'a' which doesn't match empty string)\nSo, for i=1 (s[0] is 'a'), j=1:\np[0] is 'a', s[0] is 'a', so dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\nFor j=1, i=2:\np[0] is 'a' which doesn't match s[1], so dp[2][1] is False.\n\nThus, dp[2][1] is False, which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: s = \"aa\", p = \"a*\"\n\nSo, p is \"a*\".\n\nSo, for j=2 (p[1] is '*'), dp[2][2] should be True.\n\nIn the DP table:\n\ndp[0][0] = True.\n\nj=1 (p[0] is 'a'):\n\ndp[0][1] is False, because 'a' can't match empty string.\n\ni=1, j=1: s[0] is 'a', p[0] is 'a' → dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\ni=2, j=1: p[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'a' → dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] which is False, because dp[i-1][j-1] is dp[1][0], which is False. Wait, no, wait, for j=1, p[0] is 'a', and s[i-1] is 'a' for i=2. So, since p[j-1] is 'a' and s[i-1] is 'a', then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]. So for i=2, j=1: dp[2][1] = dp[1][0] which is False, because dp[1][0] is False.\n\nBut in the case where p[j-1] is '*', for j=2, i=2:\n\ndp[2][2] = dp[2][1] or dp[1][2]\n\nBut for j=2, p[1] is '*'.\n\nSo, for i=2, j=2:\n\ndp[2][2] = dp[2][1] (if '*' matches zero) OR dp[1][2] (if '*' matches one or more).\n\nBut what is dp[2][1]?\n\nIn this case, p[0] is 'a' and s[1] is 'a', but dp[2][1] is dp[1][0] which is False. So, dp[2][1] is False.\n\nBut dp[1][2] would be dp[1][1] OR dp[0][2] (if j-1 is 1, p[1] is '*').\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to code the 2D approach and test it against some test cases.\n\nAnother test case: s = \"ab\", p = \"*\".\n\nThen, the pattern is \"*\", which can match any string, including \"ab\".\n\nSo, dp[0][1] is True.\n\nFor i=1, j=1: p[j-1] is '*', so dp[1][1] = dp[1][0] or dp[0][1]. dp[1][0] is False (since j=0 is only True at i=0). dp[0][1] is True. So, dp[1][1] = True.\n\nSimilarly, for i=2, j=1: dp[2][1] = dp[2][0] (False) OR dp[1][1] (True). So, dp[2][1] is True.\n\nSo, the final dp[len(s)][len(p)] is True.\n\nAnother test case: s = \"ab\", p = \"?*\"\n\np is \"?*\". Let's see:\n\nAt j=1, p[0] is '?', which matches any single character. So for i=1, j=1: dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] = True.\n\nAt j=2, p[1",
